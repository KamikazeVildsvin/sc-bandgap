# Switch Capacitor Bandgap Reference
This is a test of the `xschem` tool. The schematic file `sc_bandgap.sch` contains the current top-level schematic of a switched capacitor bandgap reference.

### Subcircuits
The subcircuit `transmissiongate.sch` and `transmissiongate.sym` is used to show the hierarchical structure of `xschem`. 
An ideal one pole opamp has also been created in the `opamp_onepole` schematic and symbol.

### Skywater 130nm Path
It is assumed that the `xschemrc` from the [`open_pdks`](http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/) install is handle by the user of this repo.
The repo was developed with the Skywater 130nm PDK install in the `/usr/local/share/pdk` directory.
Follow the guide on [`open_pdks`](http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/)

### Gnuplot
The `simulation` directory also contains a `gnuplot` script, used to plot the data generated by the `xyce` simulator.
This is an alternative to the waveform graph inside `xschem`, which is included in the `sc_bandgap.sch` schematic.
