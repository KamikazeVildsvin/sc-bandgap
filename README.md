# Switch Capacitor Bandgap Reference
This is a test of the `xschem` tool. The schematic file `sc-bandgap.sch` contains the current top-level schematic of the switched capacitor bandgap reference.
### Subcircuits
The subcircuit `transmissiongate.sch` and `transmissiongate.sym` is used to show the hierarchical structure of `xschem`. 
An ideal one pole opamp has also been created in the `opamp_onepole` schematic and symbol.
